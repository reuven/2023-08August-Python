    "Abstraction: The idea that you can brush aside, or ignore, the lower-level details of something and then concentrate on the higher-level ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as your car contains hundreds or thousands of parts and processes, but you only pay attention to a small number of them when you are driving, your software will typicaly contain hundreds or thousands or millions of parts and processes. You cannot possibly concentrate on one part of the software if you're trying to pay attention to all of those underlying parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows us to sweep up all of that detail under a single word/name. That allows us to concentrate on the things that are really important to us.  Moreover, if you can abstract away the details under a single name, then you can communicate about those details very quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a way for us to define a new verb in Python. We cannot do anything new -- anything we could have done with a function, we could also have done without a function. However, by using a function, we are able to wrap up a bunch of functionality into a single term, which allows us to communicate with others on our team, and with ourselves, more efficiently and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the abstraction stuff (which is super important), there's another idea in programming that functions help us with. That is DRY  -- don't repeat yourself! \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen (and said) that if you have several lines in a row of code that are basically the same, you should wrap those up into a loop. That helps your code be DRY.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the same code in multiple places, instead of repeating yourself, you can define a function and then call the function in all of those places. This reduces the cognitive load, because you don't have to think about all of those details and all of those lines of code in each place. Moreover, it means that if/when you change, improve, or debug your code, you only have to do it  in a single place.\n",
