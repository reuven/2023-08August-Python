    "\n",
    "Just as your car contains hundreds or thousands of parts and processes, but you only pay attention to a small number of them when you are driving, your software will typicaly contain hundreds or thousands or millions of parts and processes. You cannot possibly concentrate on one part of the software if you're trying to pay attention to all of those underlying parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows us to sweep up all of that detail under a single word/name. That allows us to concentrate on the things that are really important to us.  Moreover, if you can abstract away the details under a single name, then you can communicate about those details very quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a way for us to define a new verb in Python. We cannot do anything new -- anything we could have done with a function, we could also have done without a function. However, by using a function, we are able to wrap up a bunch of functionality into a single term, which allows us to communicate with others on our team, and with ourselves, more efficiently and easily.\n",

This reduces the cognitive load, because you don't have to think about all of those details and all of those lines of code in each place. Moreover, it means that if/when you change, improve, or debug your code, you only have to do it in a single place."

    "\n",
    "1. Over time, thinking this way will help you to think about Python  functions, and some of the weird things that can happen as a result of how they're defined.\n",
    "2. Functions and variables are in the *same namespace*. In many programming languages, you can have both a function `x` and a variable `x` at the same time, and the language keeps track of the difference. In Python, this isn't possible. Either `x` is a value or `x` is a function. But it can't be both simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a function, if there already a variable with that name defined... that variable is gone, and has been replaced by a reference to our function.\n",
