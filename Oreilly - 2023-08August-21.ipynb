The goal is generally to let you write instructions in something that's closer to how humans work/speak, and then have that program translated into a version that the computer can understand. Every language is a different set of tradeoffs between speed, readability, compatiblity, etc.\n",

    "- VBA -- relatively easy to write, but hard to maintain, and slow, and limited because it's inside of an app\n",
