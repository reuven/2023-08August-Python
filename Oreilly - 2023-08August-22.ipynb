    "A loop is a piece of code that repeats -- typically, with some variation between each \"iteration.\" \n",

    "In Python, we have two types of loops: `for` and `while`. The most common loop, by far, is a `for` loop. Here is how we can iterative over the characters in a string and print them:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Elements of a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use the reserved words `for` and `in` -- they both need to be there\n",
    "2. Between `for` and `in`, we name a variable. This variable can be named *anything you want*, so make it count!\n",
    "3. After the word `in`, we have the object over which we want to iterate.  In this case, it's `s`, the variable that currently refers to a string.\n",
    "4. Then we have a `:`, followed by an indented block.\n",
    "5. The indented block is known as the \"loop body.\"  It can be as long as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens here?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `for` turns to `s` and asks: Are you iterable?\n",
    "    - If not, then we get an error\n",
    "2. Assuming that `s` is iterable, `for` says: Give me your next thing\n",
    "    - If there are no more things to have, then `s` signals that, and the `for` loop ends\n",
    "3. `for` assigns the next thing (given by `s`) to our variable (`one_character`)\n",
    "4. We execute the loop body\n",
    "5. We return to step 2."
