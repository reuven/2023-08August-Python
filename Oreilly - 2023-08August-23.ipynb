    "# Loops\n",

    "The basic idea behind loops is that we have a task that we want to do repeatedly. Instead of typing the command many times, we type the command one time, inside of a loop, and the computer repeats things for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of loops in Python, which reflect two different types of repetition we might want to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `for` loops -- which go through a sequence (string, list, or tuple) one element at a time, letting us do something with each element.\n",
    "2. `while` loops -- which repeat the body of the loop until a condition (a la `if`) returns a `False` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops are great for:\n",
    "- Doing the same thing with each element of a sequence\n",
    "- Going through a range of numbers -- using `range`\n",
    "- Going through a list of filenames in a directory\n",
    "- Going through a list of records that you have retrieved from a database\n",
    "- Testing all of the IP addresses on your network, to make sure they're connected\n",
    "\n",
    "`while` loops are great for:\n",
    "- You know what you want to do, but don't know how long you'll have to do it -- you can identify the condition when it should end, though\n",
    "- We want to get input from the user repeatedly, and don't know when they'll stop\n",
    "- We want to get a command input from the user, and don't know how many commands they'll give us"
