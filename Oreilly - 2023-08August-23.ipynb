    "The basic idea behind loops is that we have a task that we want to do repeatedly. Instead of typing the command many times, we type the command one time, inside of a loop, and the computer repeats things for us.\n",

    "1. `for` loops -- which go through a sequence (string, list, or tuple) one element at a time, letting us do something with each element.\n",
