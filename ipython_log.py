# this is a comment. Python ignores anything starting with the # until the end of the line
# I can write as many comments as I want.
# typically, comments are used to give information to the next programmer who will work on this project.

# print is a function, it's a verb -- it does something -- and that something is display things on the screen
# print can display *anything* in Python

# after we say "print", we then use round parentheses around whatever we want to display
# if we want to display text, we need to use quotes around it, either '' or "" .
print('Hello!')   
print(2 + 5)
print('Reuven')
print(Reuven)   # no quotes? Then Python will get confused
print(Reuven
print('Reuven)
# what if I want to store my name (or someone else's name) for future use, or for reuse?
# that is where variables come in.

# if functions (like print) are verbs, then variables are pronouns referring to values.

name = 'Reuven'
name = 'Reuven'
first_name = 'Reuven'
# this is OK, but your colleagues will hate you!
first_name_of_the_instructor_for_this_course = 'Reuven'
name = 'Reuven'
print(name)
print(2 + 3)
print(10 - 5)
x = 10
y = 7

print(x + y)   # first, we do what's inside the parentheses, and we get a result
x = 'abcd'
y = 'efgh'

print(x + y)
