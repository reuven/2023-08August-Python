# I can write as many comments as I want.
# typically, comments are used to give information to the next programmer who will work on this project.

# print is a function, it's a verb -- it does something -- and that something is display things on the screen
# print can display *anything* in Python

# after we say "print", we then use round parentheses around whatever we want to display
# if we want to display text, we need to use quotes around it, either '' or "" .
print('Hello!')   
print(2 + 5)
print('Reuven')
print(Reuven)   # no quotes? Then Python will get confused
print(Reuven
print('Reuven)
# what if I want to store my name (or someone else's name) for future use, or for reuse?
# that is where variables come in.

# if functions (like print) are verbs, then variables are pronouns referring to values.

# at the end of the day, our computer is just lots of 1s and 0s
# but for our purposes at a high level, we have different types of data -- each type can do different things
